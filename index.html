                    <p> Baseball originally found its history in amateurism - the earliest tale of baseball being played by professional rules goes back to laborers playing the game
                        on the outskirts of New York City in 1857. </p>
                    <p> Consequently, it was the northeast that found itself to be the true rise of professional baseball - it was where most of the early professional teams came from. Now, however,
                        baseball is played all around the United States, and even (in some instances) outside of it. </p>
                    <p> 2016 was a pivotal year for baseball - the Chicago Cubs had won the world series for the first time in 108 years, where Kris Bryant became the first in history to hit three home
                        runs and two doubles in a game against Cincinatti.</p>
